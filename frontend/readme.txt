Hey! Ok everything looks good, but there are a few things to note:
- no deleting files and committing that change unless you meant it
- Everytime you need data from either branches PR, git pull might not do the proper changes you may want.
- if you do delete a file for whatever reason and commit it by accident even push by accident TELL ME.
